# STATISTICS - INTRODUCTION & APPLICATIONS
# ============================================

# --------------------------------------------
# 1. What is Statistics?
# --------------------------------------------
# Statistics is a field that deals with:
# 1. Collection of data
# 2. Organization of data
# 3. Analysis of data
# 4. Interpretation of data
# 5. Presentation of data

# --------------------------------------------
# 2. Why Do We Study Statistics?
# --------------------------------------------
# The main purpose of statistics is:
# - Decision making
# - Understanding data behavior
# - Identifying patterns and trends
# - Helping businesses grow and make profit

# Data helps us:
# - Understand customer behavior
# - Identify important factors
# - Make data-driven decisions

# --------------------------------------------
# 3. Role of Statistics in Decision Making
# --------------------------------------------
# At the end of the day, statistics helps us:
# - Convert raw data into meaningful insights
# - Support decisions using numbers and evidence
# - Reduce uncertainty in decision making

# --------------------------------------------
# 4. Example: Age Feature (Online Shopping)
# --------------------------------------------
age_data = [24, 27, 14, 13, 28, 29, 31, 32]

# From this data, we can calculate:
# - Mean (average age)
# - Median (middle value)
# - Distribution of age

# These help in:
# - Targeting promotional offers
# - Deciding which age group to focus on
# - Understanding customer demographics

# --------------------------------------------
# 5. Statistical Measures & Distributions
# --------------------------------------------
# Important statistical concepts:
# - Mean
# - Median
# - Distribution

# Types of distributions (to be studied later):
# - Gaussian Distribution
# - Normal Distribution
# - Standard Normal Distribution
# - Log Normal Distribution

# --------------------------------------------
# 6. Data Visualization
# --------------------------------------------
# Statistics helps in creating visual representations:
# - Histogram
# - PDF (Probability Density Function)
# - CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function)

# Purpose of visualization:
# - Better understanding of data
# - Identifying patterns
# - Easy communication with stakeholders

# --------------------------------------------
# 7. Histogram Concept
# --------------------------------------------
# Histogram:
# - Vertical bar chart
# - Shows frequency of data
# - Helps understand data distribution

# Smoothened histogram → PDF
# PDF helps identify:
# - Shape of distribution
# - Nature of data spread

# --------------------------------------------
# 8. Final Goal of Statistics
# --------------------------------------------
# - Understand the data
# - Make informed decisions
# - Improve business outcomes
# - Support strategic planning

# --------------------------------------------
# 9. Real-Life Application: Bank ATM Example
# --------------------------------------------
# Scenario:
# - Location A has an ATM
# - Location B is 5 km away
# - Bank wants to decide whether to install ATM at Location B

# Data analyzed:
# - Mean monthly transactions
# - Electricity and maintenance costs
# - Past transaction history

# Decision:
# - Based on statistical analysis
# - Data presented via charts and graphs
# - Stakeholders decide using insights

# --------------------------------------------
# 10. Who Uses Statistics?
# --------------------------------------------
# Statistics is used by:
# - Everyone (daily life decisions)
# - Machine Learning Engineers
# - Data Scientists
# - Data Analysts
# - Business Intelligence Analysts
# - Business Analytics Professionals
# - Risk Analysts
# - Even households (budgeting, planning)

# --------------------------------------------
# 11. Statistics in Healthcare (COVID Example)
# --------------------------------------------
# Use case:
# - Vaccine testing
# - Sample population selection
# - Statistical experiments
# - Safety and effectiveness analysis

# Conclusion drawn using:
# - Statistical analysis
# - Experimental data
# - Evidence-based decisions

# --------------------------------------------
# 12. Course Overview
# --------------------------------------------
# - Many terms introduced (Histogram, PDF, CDF, Distributions)
# - All topics will be covered in depth later
# - Focus on examples and real-world applications
# - Apply statistical thinking to your own domain
